- **Real-time Dashboard**: View pending orders with detailed information and quick completion actions
- **Sales Analytics**: Generate comprehensive reports showing top-selling drinks and revenue analytics
- **Smart Categorization**: Organized drink menu with Turkish coffee and tea varieties
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, professional interface with Cairo ahwa-inspired theming

## Architecture & Design Principles üèóÔ∏è

### Core OOP Concepts Implemented

#### 1. **Inheritance** üß¨

The application demonstrates classical inheritance through the drink hierarchy:

```dart
// Base class
class Drink {
  final String name;
  final double price;
  final String description;
}

// Specialized drink types inheriting from base Drink class
class Tea extends Drink {
  Tea({required super.name, required super.price, required super.description});
}

class TurkishCoffee extends Drink {
  TurkishCoffee({required super.name, required super.price, required super.description});
}
```

**Implementation Benefits:**

- **Code Reusability**: Common drink properties (name, price, description) are defined once in the base class
- **Logical Hierarchy**: Clear taxonomical organization reflecting real-world drink categories
- **Extensibility**: New drink types can be easily added by extending the Drink base class

#### 2. **Polymorphism** üé≠

Polymorphic behavior is achieved through:

```dart
// List can hold different drink types, all treated uniformly as Drink objects
final List<Drink> _allDrinks = [
  TurkishCoffee(name: 'Classic Turkish Coffee', price: 15.0, description: '...'),
  Tea(name: 'Earl Grey Tea', price: 12.0, description: '...'),
  // Both types handled identically despite being different classes
];

// Runtime type checking for specialized behavior
static List<Drink> getTurkishCoffees() => _allDrinks.whereType<TurkishCoffee>().toList();
static List<Drink> getTeas() => _allDrinks.whereType<Tea>().toList();
```

**Real-world Application:**

- Order processing treats all drinks uniformly regardless of specific type
- Menu categorization leverages runtime type identification
- Price calculations work seamlessly across all drink varieties

#### 3. **Encapsulation** üîí

Strong encapsulation principles throughout the codebase:

```dart
class DrinkDataProvider {
  // Private data - external classes cannot directly modify the drinks list
  static final List<Drink> _allDrinks = [...];

  // Controlled access through public methods with immutable returns
  static List<Drink> getAllDrinks() => List.unmodifiable(_allDrinks);
}

class OrderServiceImpl implements OrderService {
  // Private order storage - internal state hidden from external classes
  final List<Order> _orders = [];

  // Public interface provides controlled access to functionality
  @override
  bool addOrder(Order order) { /* controlled access */ }
}
```

**Security & Integrity Benefits:**

- Data integrity protection through private fields
- Controlled access via public methods
- Immutable data returns prevent external modification

#### 4. **Abstraction** üé®

Multiple levels of abstraction create clean, maintainable interfaces:

```dart
// High-level service abstractions hide implementation complexity
abstract class OrderService {
  bool addOrder(Order order);
  List<Order> getOrders();
  bool removeOrder(String orderId);
  bool completeOrder(String orderId);
}

abstract class ReportService {
  Map<Drink, int> generateReport(List<Order> orders);
}
```

**Abstraction Benefits:**

- Interface segregation allows easy testing and mocking
- Implementation details hidden from consuming code
- Easy swapping of concrete implementations (database vs. memory storage)

### SOLID Principles Implementation üõ°Ô∏è

#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** ‚úÖ

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **`Drink`**: Represents drink data and properties only
- **`Order`**: Manages order information and status
- **`OrderService`**: Handles order CRUD operations exclusively
- **`ReportService`**: Focuses solely on analytics and reporting
- **`DrinkDataProvider`**: Dedicated to drink data management
- **`OrderCubit`**: State management for order-related UI updates
- **`AppTheme`**: Centralizes all styling and theming concerns

#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** ‚úÖ

The system is open for extension but closed for modification:

```dart
// Easy to extend with new drink types without modifying existing code
class HerbalTea extends Drink {
  HerbalTea({required super.name, required super.price, required super.description});
}

// New service implementations can be added without changing interfaces
class DatabaseOrderService implements OrderService {
  // New implementation without modifying the interface
}
```

#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** ‚úÖ

Derived classes can replace base classes without breaking functionality:

```dart
// Any Drink subclass can substitute the base class seamlessly
List<Drink> drinks = [
  Tea(...),           // Can substitute Drink
  TurkishCoffee(...), // Can substitute Drink
];

// All implementations properly substitute their abstractions
OrderService orderService = OrderServiceImpl(); // Substitutes OrderService
ReportService reportService = ReportServiceImpl(); // Substitutes ReportService
```

#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** ‚úÖ

Clients depend only on interfaces they actually use:

```dart
// OrderService provides only order-related operations
abstract class OrderService {
  bool addOrder(Order order);
  List<Order> getOrders();
  bool removeOrder(String orderId);
  bool completeOrder(String orderId);
}

// ReportService provides only reporting operations
abstract class ReportService {
  Map<Drink, int> generateReport(List<Order> orders);
}
```

#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** ‚úÖ

High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions:

```dart
class OrderCubit extends Cubit<OrderState> {
  // Depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations
  final OrderService orderService;      // Abstract interface
  final ReportService reportService;    // Abstract interface

  OrderCubit({required this.orderService, required this.reportService});
}

// Dependency injection in main.dart
BlocProvider(
  create: (context) => OrderCubit(
    orderService: OrderServiceImpl(),    // Concrete implementation injected
    reportService: ReportServiceImpl(),  // Concrete implementation injected
  ),
)
```

## Object-Oriented Thought Process Integration üß†

### Modularity

The application demonstrates exceptional modularity through:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles distinct business logic (orders, reports, UI)
- **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped logically within modules

### Abstraction Layers

Multiple abstraction levels provide clarity and maintainability:

1. **Data Layer**: Models (`Drink`, `Order`) represent core business entities
2. **Service Layer**: Abstract services (`OrderService`, `ReportService`) define business operations
3. **State Layer**: Cubit pattern manages application state and UI interactions
4. **Presentation Layer**: Widgets handle user interface and user experience

### Real-World Business Modeling

The object model accurately reflects actual ahwa business operations:

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Classes represent real business concepts (drinks, orders, customers)
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Methods mirror actual business processes (adding orders, completing orders, generating reports)
- **State Management**: Order status tracking reflects real-world order lifecycle

## Technical Implementation üîß

### State Management

- **BLoC Pattern**: Reactive state management with `flutter_bloc`
- **Immutable State**: Predictable state updates and debugging
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Clean separation between UI events and business logic

### Data Management

- **In-Memory Storage**: Current implementation for prototype/demo purposes
- **Repository Pattern**: Service abstractions allow easy database integration
- **Data Provider Pattern**: Centralized data access and management

### UI/UX Design

- **Material Design 3**: Modern, accessible interface components
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive design for various screen sizes
- **Contextual Theming**: Cairo ahwa-inspired color scheme and typography
